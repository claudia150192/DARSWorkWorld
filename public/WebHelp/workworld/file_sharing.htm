<h1>File Sharing</h1>
<p>File sharing, an optional feature of WorkWORLD, allows you to share some or all of your case files with selected other users of WorkWorld Web. It also allows other users to share their files with you.</p>
<p>You decide whether to share one or more of your cases and, if so, decide which other WorkWORLD users to share the cases with.</p>
<p>You separately decide whether to allow other users to share their cases with you and, if so, decide whether you want to receive an email when someone else wants to share a case with you.</p>
<p>To maintain confidentiality, users of WorkWORLD have login names, which do not have to be their actual names. To share files, you <font style="font-style:italic;">must</font> know the login name of the person you wish to share your files with. Likewise, for someone else to share a file with you, they <font style="font-style:italic;">must</font> know your login name. Other users can not gain access to your account, and you can not access other users’ accounts simply because a login name is known.</p>
<p>Email notifications are sent to the email address stored in each user’s Personal Profile page described above. For privacy and security reasons, email addresses are <font style="font-style:italic;">never</font> visible to other users. If you decide to share one of your cases, you will see a list of login names for those users who have chosen to receive fileshare. When you decide which users to share with, an email is sent to the users you selected if they have chosen to receive share email.</p>
<p>By default, none of the file sharing option are active at registration unless you change them. That is, unless you change the options, your choices are no sharing of you files with other users, no receiving other users shared files, and no email notifications from other users.</p>
<h2>Changing File Sharing Options</h2>
<p>You can change how you want file sharing to work for you at any time. When you register as a WorkWORLD user, you choose initial file sharing options. To change these later, use Display, Personal Profile from the main menu bar near the top of most WorkWORLD page screens. When your profile displays, use Edit near the bottom of that page to reach the Edit Account screen where you can change and update your information</p>
<p>If you do plan to share your files with anyone else, check “Allow Fileshare”. If you want others to be able to share their files with you, check “Receive Fileshare”. Finally, if you want the WorkWorld Web system to send you an email to notify you when someone else wants to share with you, check “Receive Share Email”. Click the checkbox again to uncheck a previously checked option.</p>
<p>After making the desired changes, chose Update at the bottom of the screen to save your new choices.</p>
<h2>Sharing a File</h2>
<p>To share a file, use Case, Share from the main menu bar near the top of most WorkWORLD page screens.</p>
<p>You will get a Listing Cases page that shows a list of all of your cases. You can select one or more of these files to share with other users. Click the checkbox at the left side of the list to select a file for sharing. A checkmark will appear. Click again to deselect the file. You can select any number of files to share.</p>
<p>Below the file selection table is a list of users willing to receive shared files. You can select one or more of these users to share your files with. Use the scroll bar to find the correct user, then click on the user name to select it. The name will be highlighted. Click again to deselect it. You can select additional people to share with by holding down the control key (Ctrl) when clicking. You can select any number of users.</p>
<p>When you have both selected the files you wish to share and the users to share them with, click the Share button below the users list. The file checkboxes and user highlighting will be cleared, and your files will appear in the case listings of the users you selected with a “(shared)” notation after the file name.</p>
