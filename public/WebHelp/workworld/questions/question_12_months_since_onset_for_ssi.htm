<h1>Question - 12 Months Since Onset for SSI</h1>
<p>Select “Yes” if it has been at least 12 months from the onset of your disability as determined by the Social Security Administration (SSA) for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) eligibility purposes, or “No” if it has not.</p>
<p>When the Social Security Administration (SSA) makes a final determination of your eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), you receive a notification of final determination. If you have not received that notification, or if you do not know whether or not you have received it, you should answer No to the question. If you do not know, contact your SSI claims representative to find out your status.</p>
<p>You should be aware that if, prior to the final determination date, you have earnings that exceed the Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) amount, you may be determined ineligible for SSI unless you have an Unsuccessful Work Attempt.</p>
<p>The rules do say, however, that if you begin engaging in SGA a year or more after the "onset" of your disability, then rather than lose your eligibility you will retain your SSI benefits under the provisions of 1619(a) and 1619(b) -- even if you have not yet received notification of final determination. For SSI purposes the onset date is usually the date of application for SSI.</p>
<p>If you have not received notification of final determination and you have an opportunity to attempt working at the SGA level, you should contact your SSA claims representative to find out if doing so would jeopardize your SSI eligibility.</p>
