<h1>Question - Spouse Disability</h1>
<p>Select “Yes” if your spouse has a disability according to SSA criteria, or “No” if your spouse does not.</p>
<p>SSA defines disability for individuals aged 18 or older as:<br>
1. The inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.<br>
2. Also, a person must not only be unable to do his or her previous work but cannot, considering age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy. It is immaterial whether such work exists in the immediate area, or whether a specific job vacancy exists, or whether the worker would be hired if he or she applied for work.</p>
<p>An individual under age 18 must have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe functional limitations and which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.</p>
