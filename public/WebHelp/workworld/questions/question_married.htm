<h1>Question - Married</h1>
<p>Select “Yes” if you are married, or “No” if you are not.</p>
<p>If you live in the same household with a person of the opposite sex, SSA may consider you to be married.</p>
<p>This is important for two reasons:<br>
1. If your spouse also gets SSI, then SSA may consider the two of you to be a "Couple on SSI" and give you a combined cash benefit that is less than the sum of your individual benefits. This is because the Federal Benefit Rate for couples is less than twice that for individuals.<br>
2. If your spouse does not get SSI, then SSA may deem some of that person’s income to you, lowering your benefit amount.</p>
<p>A man and woman are "married" for SSI purposes if they are living in the same household and are married under the laws of their State; or if they are holding themselves out as husband and wife to the community in which they live; or if one is entitled, as the spouse of the other, to Social Security benefits.</p>
